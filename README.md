# PYTHON-ONLINE-FOOD-ORDER-PROJECT

Iâ€™ve completed a Python project on online food orders, where I analyzed the entire dataset and uncovered several key insights. These insights include the most orders, customer ratings, purchasing power, and more. The data also reveals details such as whether restaurants prefer online or offline orders, approximate costs for couples, and other relevant metrics.
